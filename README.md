# MetroTransit
This is a Pebble Application that works only in the Minneapolis and St Paul area to provide the expected arrival times for the Greenline Metro Transit train.
It uses the location of your phone to determine the nearest station and the expected arrival of the next two trains at that station. It uses Metro Transit's API to determine the train arrival times.

It is currently compatible with the original Pebble Watches (Pebble and Pebble Steel), and the Pebble Time Watches (The Pebble Time and Pebble Time Steel). It currently does not have support for the Pebble Time Round, that support is expected soon.

The pebble app uses an API, which has the code available at https://github.com/benpete22/Metro.

# Current State of Development
The application is in a very young state, so it does not have much error checking as of yet, and that is my next goal.



# Future Features to be Implemented
* Addition of Pebble timeline pins to notify you of the next train on your time line. I am not sure how annoying that would be until I try it.
* Add the functionality to check the nearest bus stop and its times... but that is more complicated, as we need to know more on where the person is going...



# Questions? Feature Suggestions? Comments?
Feel free to add a new issue under the repo, and I will get to it right away. :) I am very open to suggestions as I am developing this application.
